                    <h2>Why Am I Here?</h2> 
                    <p>Understand this miracle of the eight billion to one uniqueness. This miracle, called a human being, and namely you, has an opportunity to answer the question, "What is my purpose for being?" This great mystery, called a human being's journey, asks from each of us a uniquely profound thing. A great step for one person will not be so for the next. Each of us is given the perfect opportunity to make the choice that will be our soul's greatest stretch.</p> 
                    
                    <h2>What Is This Calling Me To?</h2> 
                    <p>If our Destiny is everything we're here for, then in every beauty, heartbreak, disappointment, test, and wonderful, magical, mystical thing that life has to give, reminds us: Our calling is in every moment of faith and hope, when the sun has yet to rise, that our soul requires to know that we know, that we know our Destiny and its why. As Monica from the old television series, Touched by An Angel, tells us, "I never said it would be easy. I just said it would be worth it." </p>
                    
                    <h2>Who Does That Call Me To Become? </h2>
                    <p>The person that we know ourselves to be today is the result of all the small choices we've made, leading to all the big choices that follow. The person that we know ourselves to be today, is the result of all the small choices we’ve made leading to all the big choices that follow. If you want to manifest a why, you’ll have to let go of who you think you are to become who you’re called to be.</p>

                <p>A shared vision isn’t enough to create the world we most want. We all have skills, talents and gifts to offer, yet if we haven’t learned to listen to a deeper sense of call, we’ll miss the ignition we need to fully bring about the changes we want to see. Our world needs each of us to step into the greatness that is ours to be, do and become. We are in a time when being at the right place at the right time to bring about what is within us to come forth will come down to our skillful presence, in the unique way each of us is designed to express.</p>
